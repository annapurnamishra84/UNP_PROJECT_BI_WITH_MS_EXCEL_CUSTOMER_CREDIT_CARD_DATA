# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP.This project focuses on analyzing a dataset titled Customer Credit Card Data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset contains detailed information about customers, including demographics, card types, and transaction patterns.Throughout the project, various Excel tools were utilized to clean, organize, and analyze the data effectively. Key techniques such as pivot tables, pivot charts, filters, and conditional formatting were applied to extract meaningful insights. The pivot tables helped in summarizing large amounts of data, identifying trends like spending behaviors, card usage frequency, and customer segmentation based on demographic factors.To present the findings in a visually clear and interactive manner, a dashboard was created at the end. The dashboard combines key metrics, graphs, and slicers, allowing users to easily navigate through different aspects of the data and gain quick insights. It provides an overview of important indicators such as top-performing card types, customer spending patterns, and demographic distributions.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of Excel's powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities to transform raw customer credit card data into actionable insights, supporting better business decision-making.
